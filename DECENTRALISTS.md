We prefer to operate with radical transparency in the open, and our name should
reflect our values, so we hereby call ourselves the "Decentralists". The
Decentralists are the opposition conservative party for the Cosmos Hub named
Gaia, and AtomOne is the Decentralists' initial ICS host. 

Decentralists:
 * Embody radical transparency.
 * Accept both splitting and negotiating.
 * Define protocols for interoperability.
 * Finish software given a name.
 * Respect first principles, so
 * Require constitutions and bylaws.
 * Create rather than destroy.

It is important to note that AtomOne is a proof-of-stake hub governed by $ATONE
tokens, while the Decentralists is a membership oriented quasi-political party
with members associated with various companies (or individual proprietors). The
various missions and objectives of this party may eventually drift from the
missions and objectives of AtomOne because the people may be focused on
different things over time and less on time-proven infrastructure, but the core
values must remain the same and the vision compatible with those declared here.

AtomOne may enforce criteria for Decentralists membership (and temporary bans
and suspensions) with a Constitutional Majority for the purpose of ensuring the
alignment of the Decentralists members with AtomOne, provided that it also
offers everyone the right (through Apache2.0 or more liberal licenses, or
\*GPL\* and GnoPL licenses) and the ability with reasonable ease to maintain a
prior fork of Decentralists membership under a different brand name distinct
from either AtomOne or Decentralists. 

This initial tight coupling is necessary between AtomOne and the Decentralists
brands because the success of either are tied together and we prefer a more
open membership policy for the Decentralists for growth, but the people
ultimately determine what a name means. After a period of 7 years after genesis
the Decentralists can vote via a supermajority or constitutional majority to
become self-sovereign and remove the ability for AtomOne to enforce anything
about the membership of the Decentralists. (XXX maybe replace with a curve).
Correspondingly AtomOne can choose any other membership group (or any other
type of group or DAO) to replace the Decentralists at that time with the same
system but with a new criteria for membership, under a new name.

Initially the only criteria for Decentralists membership is that members hold
any nonzero amount of $ATONE or $phATOM\* tokens (more on $phATOM later) and
agree with the spirit of the Founding Documents, and agree to at all times
abide by and enforce the living AtomOne Constitution for the AtomOne hub.

While we respect the stakers and the staking distribution, we also recognize
that the unequal token distribution must be balanced by the natural inalienable
God given powers to individual humans who are vital to make this project
succeed. While the voting on AtomOne is handled solely by the $ATONE stakers,
the Decentralists self-organize as a whole and with groups within, and every
proposal in the governance of the Gaia and AtomOne hubs as well as every open
group are enriched with the best arguments from both sides of the isle as
measured by feedback from all the members of the Decentralists. In short, the
democratic distribution offered by the Decentralists is used to rank the
arguments for and against every proposal to be voted on by stakeholders.

The chain explorers and wallets that display information about AtomOne and Gaia
hub proposals and the proposals of Decentralists open groups should display the
Decentralists official summary in full (but can customize the order or make
highlights), or they should link to the appropriate Decentralists resource so
users can see all of the related commentary. These are not enforced but are
incentivized through the portion of block rewards reserved for blockchain
explorers and wallets. 

While it may appear that the Decentralists and its integration into AtomOne are
unnecessary complexifications not fit for a "minimal hub", it does address the
real need for a long term development roadmap for AtomOne to improve our
communications amidst irreconcilable differences, the need to give
self-aligned groups more voice through self-organization, and the need for a
long term vision of a market of competing systems and designs that incorporate
a comprehensive range of components from virtual machines, smart contract
systems, DAO frameworks, to end-user interfaces; that offer transparent and
accountable disbursement of funds and decision making for every organization.
The tooling we develop under the brand of Decentralists will be made available
broadly in all communities and serve to introduce more people to AtomOne and
its generations.

Portions of the constitution regarding the Decentralists, only the
Decentralists can vote to change. 

The Decentralists may adopt a new constitution with a 2/3 supermajority, until this clause is revoked... /// XXX ok but now this is confusing. AtomOne vs Decentralists having separate constitutions? 
XXX The Decentralists should also have a minimal constitution.
XXX move and refactor
The Decentralists may elect to add with a 2/3 supermajority a new Judicial System. Each Judicial System will have a 

##### decentralists UX.....
The initial implementations of UX will be provided by anyone or any community
that wants to implement the whole vertical stack required from maintaining a
chain to the end user interfaces required. AIB & NT along with those aligned
with the GnoVM will work on one implementation, but all reasonable stacks
will be supported such as those that run on (Cosm)WASM as long as there is a
responsible party willing to commit.

Create tooling to help members register themselves with their associations,
and to allow these members to self-organize into open and closed (yet
transparent) groups in a permissionless way. Each group should have their
own respective founding documents, constitution, mission, bylaws, etc.
Companies as entities also get representation, and everyone must declare
their associations and use their real identities (in order to prevent sybil
attacks).

 * Fix the governance functions from the CosmosSDK and port these and core sdk
   modules to Tendermint2.
 * Implement AtomOne according to the specifications here and other Founding
   Documents linked to from here, and make payments for these purposes from an
   internal Decentralists Treasury separate from the AtomOne community pool,
   and conduct releases according to the roadmap specified here and other
   Founding documents with oversight by the $ATONE stakers.

AtomOne will subsidize at least one ICS shard if needed, to serve as the zone
for the Decentralists' dapp/DAO needs, including hosting a dapp for
self-organized conversations.

These arguments provided by the Decentralists for and against every proposal
and the default ranking of them by the Decentralists are not hosted on the root
hub, but shall not be deployed until they are hosted on a separate ICS zone.
