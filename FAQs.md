## AtomOne vs Gaia

AtomOne is designed as an alternative fork of Gaia with a distinct focus on
minimalism in its ICS & Token IBC hub. This results in a leaner, more efficient
architecture. In terms of governance, AtomOne introduces a higher consensus
threshold (Constitutional Majority) and emphasizes decentralized
decision-making. In terms of software, AtomOne will start as a fork of
"cosmoshub4".

## AtomOne vs Gno.land

Gno.land will be a hub for GnoVM based smart contracts. It may benefit from
ICS1.5 in the future, but we will first offer GnoVM scaling on the AtomOne ICS
economic zone. Gno.land will not connect to Gaia and other external chains for
the purpose of token pegging except indirectly through AtomOne, or its minimal
successor (how a hub is meant to be used).

Gno.land will run its own separate validator set but the Gno VM will be made
available for hosting on AtomOne ICS and its successors.
