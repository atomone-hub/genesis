# Forking Guide

In a similar fashion to the CONTRIBUTING.md, the FORKING.md file helps people
understand when and how they should fork. This isn't a common practice, so let's
dive into the specifics.

For context, you can refer to this issue: [#64](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/64). 

## What is this repository about?

This genesis repository is about forking, specifically forking cosmos-hub-4 and
gaia. The primary objective here is to help people switch from the perception
that forking is necessarily bad, to the understanding that it could be useful
and eventually the best thing to do.

Forking is not always about competition with the original fork. It can also be
about exploring alternative paths that could potentially merge or be used in
parallel. A fork is also, by nature, something that can fail and just be an
experiment. But even in failure, the goal is to learn lessons.

Forking is not necessarily bad, but the goal is to avoid making bad forks. We
aim to optimize the forking process to maximize chances of success and
efficiency.

This repository was created with the expectation that it will be forked, a lot,
and probably recursively with potential grand-grand-grand-children.

## What to Fork?

You can fork this genesis repository as a plan, or you can fork a chain (the
software, its communities). When you fork a chain, you need to have a plan; this
repo is the plan.

Once our plan is finished, the goal is for blockchain(s) to be run using that
plan. The plan is intended to become finished at some point, so that if we want
to do differently, we fork the plan and propose a new one.

So to say it differently; a plan is independent and becomes implemented with the
launch of new blockchains; 1 plan can have 0 to N implementations; plans can be
forked to other plans even without implementation; and then we can think about
creating new plans from existing chains.

Just take care with the term fork; itâ€™s the same word for a git fork which is
relatively light and low in engagement, and about launching a real chain.

## Why to Fork this Repo?

You can fork this genesis repository for multiple reasons:

1. **Contributing:** If you want to contribute to the development of this
   project, forking is the first step.
2. **Maintaining a branch:** You might want to maintain a branch for an
   alternate plan for a fork of gaia in the spirit of this repository.
3. **Splitting another project:** If you want to discuss the genesis of a split
   for another project.

## How to Fork?

If you want to fork this repo, make sure:
- the vision/mission statements and the development/growth/maintenance plans in
the README are substantially different (you should explain why the fork is
needed).
- Branding, trademark tickers also need to be unique.
