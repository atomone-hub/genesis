**Brief Summary of Discussion will go here**

<br>

- Engineering updates:
  - Updates on $ATONE distribution: given last Townhall discussions, we
    investigated on higher multipliers for the No voters, and it appears that the
    x9 multiplier is the best fit for our case because:
    - No Voters get more than 60% of the supply
    - Yes voters get 1/3 of their initial part of the supply
    - Here is the general bar chart that shows the votes distribution with No
    multipliers from x4 to x10:

    - Here is a more detailled pie chart of the $ATONE distribution for the x9
    multiplier:

    - All the charts are visibles [here](https://atomone-hub.github.io/govbox/).
    
  - 'How to Submit Transactions Securely' guide has been merged and is available
    [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen-proposals/blob/main/submit-tx-securely.md)

- Further conversation on Defining "ICS 1.5": https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/66#issuecomment-2006912939
- Further conversation on what the relationship between Photon Atom vs Photon Atone might look like, to be discussed as a community over the coming weeks.

- Urgencies in constitution for minimal working draft to move forward such as,
  - How exactly to reform governance
  - Remove NWV or remove delegations altogether
  - Remove validator commission, include fixed rate
  - Validator distribution
  - Validators have machines onsite, i.e no white labels, no AWS
  - Validators should declare conflicts of interest
  - Should not roll out fixes that validators don't understand
  - If anything to be added to constitution, should be unchallenged for a given term (3 months?)
  - Potentially funding multiple teams of leading developers to compete to build ICS
