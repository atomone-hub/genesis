- Engineering updates on latest state of distribution prop draft: https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen-proposals/pull/5
    - We took into account the community feedback regarding the previous
      distribution, especially the fact that non-voters (including abstrainers)
      had too much of the supply (61%). As a result we replaced the blend
      formula with an other formula that ensures the non-voters don't get more
      than 33% of the supply.
    - In addition, we decided to apply a 0.1 decimation factor to the entire
      supply.

- Distribution proposal companion doc (and code): https://github.com/atomone-hub/govbox/blob/master/PROP-001.md
    - Added details on the new formula mentioned above
- Further conversation on Defining "ICS 1.5": https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/66#issuecomment-2006912939
- Further conversation on what the relationship between Photon Atom vs Photon Atone might look like, to be discussed as a community over the coming weeks. 

- Urgencies in constitution for minimal working draft to move forward such as,
  - How exactly to reform governance
  - Remove NWV or remove delegations altogether
  - Remove validator commission, include fixed rate
  - Validator distribution
  - Validators have machines onsite, i.e no white labels, no AWS
  - Validators should declare conflicts of interest
  - Should not roll out fixes that validators don't understand
  - If anything to be added to constitution, should be unchallenged for a given term (3 months?)
  - Potentially funding multiple teams of leading developers to compete to build ICS
