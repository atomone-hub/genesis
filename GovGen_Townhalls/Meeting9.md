- Further conversation on what the relationship between Photon Atom vs Photon Atone might look like, to be discussed as a community over the coming weeks. 

- Urgencies in constitution for minimal working draft to move forward such as,
  - How exactly to reform governance
  - Remove NWV or remove delegations altogether
  - Remove validator commission, include fixed rate
  - Validator distribution
  - Validators have machines onsite, i.e no white labels, no AWS
  - Validators should declare conflicts of interest
  - Should not roll out fixes that validators don't understand
  - If anything to be added to constitution, should be unchallenged for a given term (3 months?)
  - Potentially funding multiple teams of leading developers to compete to build ICS
