**Suggested Talking Points**
- Validator Onboarding Process & Timeline
  - The initial communicated deadline for submission was Friday, February 23, at 5 p.m. PST (Saturday, 1 a.m. UTC). However, the term has been extended until Saturday, February 24, at 5 p.m. PST (Sunday, 1 a.m. UTC). 
- Technical Updates and Governance Discussions
  - errata corrige: [PR 7](https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen/issues/7) is superseded by [PR 20](https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen/issues/20): validators are allowed to vote in governance, but delegations won't count there, and validators can vote on proposals only using self-stake. Block production/tendermint voting power distribution/staking will work regularly though.
  - GovGen v1.0.0 released: https://github.com/atomone-hub/govgen/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- First Proposals for GovGen
- Cover any questions
