**Brief Summary of Discussion**

<br>

Technical Updates and Governance Discussions:
- Distribution is 1:1 with No and NWV voters, initial distribution will probably be ~ 68m million GovGen tokens
- GovGen will have a few changes from the starting point of the fork of Cosmos Hub:

   - GovGen is non-transferable
   - Inflation Disabled
   - Community tax, proposer reward and bonus all set to 0
   - Deposit raised to 5000 GovGen
   - Voting period suggested to be extended to 365 days, discussion followed on different voting periods for different types of proposals, specifically for software upgrades, changing parameters. Conversation followed some consensus with talks about voting incentives then shut down.
   - Vote threshold set to 2/3
   - Quorum raised to 50%
   - Validators tentatively reduced to 30
   - Standard SDK v14.1 without the liquid-staking module
   - IBC module removed
   - ICS module removed
   - Spam prevention changed to 1% of initial deposit by proposer
   - GovGen will probably skip the testnet phase.
 
- Discussion on whether distribution should go to all Atom Holders / stakers with the exception of slashing Yes Voters
- Discussion on distribution going to CEXes, could be beneficial but will ultimately need to be voted on by Govgen
- Discussion on timeline of GovGen, ideally by Q1 for GovGen, AtomOne dependent on community vote from GovGen
- Discussion on KYC, ideally a decentralized non-date-broker option

- Validator Onboarding Process
- Part of the conversation focused on onboarding validators, discussing criteria, documentation and verification steps.
  - Some discussion on who will handle evaluation for GovGen validators, no conclusion as we may not have more than 30
  - Some discussion on what will happen if there's more than 30 validators, potentially expand validator set
    
- Governance Mechanisms and Validator Requirements
   - Discussion on how to proceed with multiple choice proposals
   - Only allowing tokens staked at the time of a proposal
