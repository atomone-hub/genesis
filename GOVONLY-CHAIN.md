# Governance-Only Chain

The governance-only chain is the initial phase of the AtomOne project, aimed at
creating a strong governance framework before adding more complex features like
token transfers, IBC, and ICS. This early launch strategy emphasizes community
input and the refinement of governance in a controlled setting.

Further details will explain the constitution's role and how the governance-only
chain will transition to Phase 2, introducing broader functionalities.
