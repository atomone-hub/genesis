# Milestones

There are largely four phases to this plan.

## AtomOne Phase 1: Pre-IBC

1. Define Constitution
2. Governance Fixes
3. Launch Governance-Only Chain
4. Implement IBC

## AtomOne Phase 2: Post-IBC

1. $PHOTON with Auto-Staking
2. Fix Validator Incentives
3. Implement ICS1.5
4. Prototypes with SubDAOs (including GNO)

## AtomOne Phase 3: ICS1.5 scaling

1. Migrate $PHOTON to ICS
2. Promote Smart Contract Use Cases
3. Develop Scalable Validator Infrastructure
4. Develop Recovery Procedures

## AtomOne Phase 4: Maintenance

1. Create OnChain Education Curriculum
2. Promote Good Forks and Projects
3. Promote Other Common Goods
4. Finalize the Software

Finalization should not be seen as a thing to avoid, but rather a necessity for
preserving immutability and thus providing real security benefits.

Everyone who wants something different is given a way to create their own
variation to compete and cooperate with the AtomOne hub. We should all be
familiar with this concept, as it is how AtomOne itself was born--by exodus
from Gaia.

It is possible that what we arrive at is not sufficient in the long run, and
that is still OK; the ultimate goal is to be a standard reference, in the very
least in relation to an improved fork; a reference that will last a thousand
years or more.

In short, the goal is nothing more than to create timeless code, even knowing
that in the end even AtomOne will be phased out, but never forgotten; the
template will have split into a million different forks and conquered the
world. AtomOne Eschatology will be well documented and planned, for a time when
nobody was around for these early beginnings.
