# TODO

- [ ] Must replicate, understand, and validate the genesis distribution. See https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/pull/65#pullrequestreview-1775992431
- [ ] Must contribute to the above to prove understanding of it. Ideally every validator contributes something, even if it is just comments in code.
- [ ] Incorporate global decentralization mandate; require validators to cooperate in translations; this guarantees global reach.
- [ ] Describe tiers and participation levels, and limitations.
- [ ] Transparency disclosures required, of associations among validators. (Also see https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/75)
